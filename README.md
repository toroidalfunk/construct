# construct
Javascript adaptation of the python modules construct and construct3 for declarative parsing of binary file formats.

Substantially incomplete; almost entirely limited to what I'm actually using to avoid unit testing.

BinaryReader and BinaryWriter implementations cribbed, base64 implementation copied wholesale, from [CM3D2Editor](https://github.com/MainVirtualizer/CM3D2Editor), where ever they got them from...

Overall concept derived from [construct](https://github.com/construct/construct) and [construct3](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/construct3)
